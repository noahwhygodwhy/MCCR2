# Mineccraft Renderer Attempt Number 2

~This time I am going to plan a lot more before starting any actual coding. Created this repo so early to connect to a documentation solution.~

Want to do more with instancing and smarter memory management. Last time was MESSY.

Started porting over the stuff that worked well. Mostly done with implementing smarter chunk loading. Doing it by chunk, instead of just the entire world. That was a bit silly.
