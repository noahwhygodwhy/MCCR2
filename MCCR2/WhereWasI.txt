Future noah,

So you were dealing with an issues with UVs not being applied correctly to blocks.

You traced this issue to minecraft coordinate systems being weird. (rotated by 90 or 180 degrees, idk)

You maaaaybe fixed it, but UV rotation is still messed up. It should bea easier to figure out now that blocks are (probably) being constructed correctly.
Pistons were a bad example as they used the same texture on multiple sides, so when the wrong face was on the wrong side, it was hard to tell. stuff like crafting tables,
and furnaces, stuff with different textures on different sides.

Good luck,

Past Noah

PS The axis indicator doodad is still contradicting the text display of coordinates.
